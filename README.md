# TekstoSense | Text Sense Simplified

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/about-tekstosense/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/about-tekstosense/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/about-tekstosense/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Do you know our website name [TekstoSense][tekstosense-url] is derived using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network: a special type of RNN? Is it not fun ? Yes it is.
Teksto in [Esperanto][Esperanto] means Text. Tekstosense is one stop apis hub for all the text analytics need. 
We want our users to focus on their market proposition and differentiation and we provides all possible building blocks for text analytics ecosystem to reduce their time to market.

## Features

Have you ever faced twin tombstone problems of text analytics area i.e. accuracy and speed? Have you ever looked for free production grade text analytics APIs which performs out the box and satisfies your need? If your answer is yes your search ends here. TekstoSense is a suit of text analytics APIs which is based on unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised machine learning algorithms. 

- **CLI**: Control your TekstoSense APIs from the command line just like Neo in The
  Matrix.
- **REST API**: TekstoSense can be operated with its RESTful API for maximum
  flexibility.
- **Rule Based Configurations**: Configs are always available to change based on your requirement at run time.
- **Scalability**: Distributed by nature, TekstoSense APIs scales horizontally simply by
  adding nodes. Processing layer is based on Spark.
- **Performance**: TekstoSense APIs handles load with ease by scaling the core.
- **Dependency**: Simple to use with minimal dependencies.
- **Distribution**: Single Mode APIs with Apache license and Batch Mode APIs with Commercialised license.
- **Deployable**: Deployed on google cloud with [kubernate](http://kubernetes.io/). Plug and play for on-premise or cloud distribution.

## Why TekstoSense?

- We generally use [Opennlp](https://opennlp.apache.org/) or [Stanford NLP](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) or [LingPipe](http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/) or [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) for our text analytics need but these are just enablers framework not an out of the box APIs framework to build use cases. Similarly we have lots of Deep-Learning frameowrk. To develop use cases we need to build bridges between two pillars of text analytics , NLP at one side and Machine Learning at the other side. TekstoSense bridge that gap and provides ready to use text analytics API.

- If you ever hesitated to use unsupervised algorithm based solution into your product due to unsatisfactory accuracy then  simply forget the past and forge toward the TekstoSense. It provides high accuracy for its algorithms and APIs.
 TekstoSense provides usecase centric APIs.
