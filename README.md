Teksto in [Esperanto][Esperanto] means Text. Tekstosense is one stop hub for all text analytics need. 
Do you know our [website][tekstosense-url] name itself is derived using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network: a special type of RNN? Is it not fun ? Yes it is.
We want to make implementation of text analytics a fun for all those users who want to seriously differentiate their product with others.
